# Creating a Good Video Thumbnail

A professional thumbnail for your demo video will help users understand what to expect and increase engagement. Follow these guidelines to create an effective thumbnail:

## Thumbnail Specifications

- **File name**: `demo-thumbnail.jpg`
- **File location**: `frontend/public/assets/demo-thumbnail.jpg`
- **Recommended size**: 1280x720 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **File format**: JPG (preferred) or PNG
- **File size**: Keep under 200KB for fast loading

## Design Guidelines

For the best results, your thumbnail should:

1. **Show the final 3D model** - Include a screenshot of a completed 3D face model in the software
2. **Include your 3D software UI** - Show the interface of Blender, MeshLab, Maya, or whatever 3D software you're demonstrating
3. **Add descriptive text** - Consider adding text like "3D Face Model Tutorial" or "How to Use Your 3D Model"
4. **Use contrasting colors** - Make sure text and important elements stand out
5. **Keep it simple** - Don't overcrowd the image with too many elements

## Creating Your Thumbnail

### Option 1: Screenshot from Your Video
1. Play your demo video and pause at a moment that clearly shows the 3D model in your software
2. Take a screenshot (Windows: Win+Shift+S, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4)
3. Edit the screenshot in an image editor to add text or enhance visibility
4. Save as `demo-thumbnail.jpg`

### Option 2: Custom Graphic
1. Create a custom image in Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, or similar software
2. Include a screenshot of your 3D model and software
3. Add overlay text explaining what users will learn
4. Use your brand colors and fonts if applicable
5. Save as `demo-thumbnail.jpg`

## Examples of Effective Elements

- Software UI showing the 3D model from multiple angles
- A side-by-side comparison of the 2D texture and 3D result
- Text overlay like "Complete 3D Face Model Guide" or "Import & Edit in Any 3D Software"
- Arrows or highlights pointing to important features
- Your logo in a corner (small and unobtrusive)

Place the finished thumbnail in `frontend/public/assets/demo-thumbnail.jpg` and restart your server if needed.
